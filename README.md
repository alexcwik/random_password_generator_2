Random Password Generator created with javascript. 

The first method used in an attempt to create this file was using Strings. It was difficult to achieve the results needed so the js code was modified to use Arrays. As a result the entire code had to be re-worked.

This was a challenging assingment and a lot of trial and error went in to get it working.
